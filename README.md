# DES PYTHON3

Encode a message using DES when encrypted. Try the following
experiments and note how they change the output:

a) Change one character at the end of the message. How much of
the encoded message changes?

b) Change one character at the beginning of the message. How
much of the encoded message changes?

c) Delete one character at the end of the message. How much of the
encoded message changes?

d) Change one character in the key. How much of the encoded
message changes?

e) Decrypt a message using a key with one character changed.
Does it look anything like the original?

## Usage

```python
k1 = 0xAABB09182736CCDD
k2 = 0xAABB09182736CCDE # changed one character at the end of the key.
#k3 = 0x133457799BBCDFF1
m1 = 0x123456ABCD132536
#m2 = 0x0123456789ABCDEF
m3 = 0x123456ABCD132537 # changed one character at the end of the message.
m4 = 0x223456ABCD132536 # changed one character at the beginning of the message
m5 = 0x123456ABCD13253 # Delete one character at the end of the message
